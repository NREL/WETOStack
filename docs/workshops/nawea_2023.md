# 2023 NAWEA / WindTech Workshops

Following the 2023 NAWEA WindTech conference, NREL hosted a series of workshops related to the
collection of wind energy software produced at the lab.
Each workshop introduced a specific software project and provided practical suggestions
for modeling and analysis.
Additionally, an overview of the WETO Software Stack and the work under the Holistic Modeling
Project was provided along with a discussion of community needs.
This page contains a listing of workshop recordings, where available, and other presentation
