# WETO Software Stack

NREL's National Wind Technology Center is currently in an effort to characterise the existing
portfolio of software supported by the Department of Energy's Wind Energy Technology Office (WETO).
Additionally, elements of the development process will be defined and best practices recommended.
The combination of these two efforts will inform a third effort to consolidate and coordinate
planning for future software development efforts.
