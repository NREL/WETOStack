# Model Owners Workshop

A component of the Holistic Modeling Portfolio Coordination Project is to coordinate and host
an annual workshop with the purpose of strengthening the community of WETO software owners.
**The first workshop will be help on September 7, 2023, at NREL's Golden Campus.**

The objective of the first workshop is to *initialize* the community.
To that end, two primary topics will be threaded throughout the conversations:
1. Opportunities and strategies to elevate the quality of WETO software
2. Holistic evaluation of the existing portfolio

There will be four breakout sessions where attendees will discuss topics as a group.
Prior to the breakouts, preplanned talks from WETO and members of the Holistic Modeling project
will seed the conversations in the breakouts. Please see the [](workshop_agenda) and
[](logistics) for details.

**All attendees are asked to complete the following tasks prior to the workshop:**
- Review the [](portfolio_listing) to ensure that all WETO-supported software within your field
  of expertise is listed.
- Create a pull request to https://github.com/rafmudaf/WETOStack with an attributes description
  for your software projects following the guidance in [](schema).
- Review the [](workshop_agenda) and [breakout session topics](breakout1).

(breakout1)=
## Breakout 1: What is the purpose of WETO Software?

This breakout session follows an update from WETO on their perspective and focus on the software
we produce.
The discussions should be informed by low-level experience but maintain a high-level perspective.
The objective of this breakout session is to establish a mutual understanding of the group's
perspective on the role and impact of WETO software within the broad context of wind energy.

Topic suggestions - The purpose of WETO software is:
- To create the tools to support our own research
- To establish a mechanism to disseminate our research
- To enable additional research in academia and industry
- To provide the industry with tools to design wind energy systems

<!-- Third option:
- how might we engage with independent organizations to deal with these long term maintenance burdens
  - inter (?) foundation
  - Apache foundation
  - Linux foundation -->

## Breakout 2: Broadly, in what direction should WETO software go?

This breakout session follows an overview of the current WETO software portfolio including
descriptions of the domain areas covered and states of maturity.
Building on the discussions in [Breakout 1](breakout1) and the portfolio overview, this session
focuses on defining the forward-looking technical and domain-specific topics that WETO software
should pursue.
The objective is to align the community's expectations around a future technical and programmatic
vision.

Topic suggestions:
- Integration to other ecosystems (AI/ML, optimizations)
- WETO software interoperability
- Professionalization / commercialization through industry partnership

## Breakout 3: What are the major bottlenecks in our development processes?

This breakout session follows an overview of [Best Practices](bestpractices) described
within the Portfolio Coordination project.
The objective is to identify the key bottlenecks in our current workflows with particular
attention to things that prevent WETO software from achieving the impacts identified
in [Breakout 1](breakout1).
The discussions here will be incorporated into the best practices technical report.

Topic suggestions:
- Staff and programmatic incentives
- Technical barriers - do we have access to the tools we need?
- Personnel barriers - do we have staff with the relevant experience?
- What's missing in the proposed best practices?

## Breakout 4: Where to invest time and efforts in the upcoming FY's

The Portfolio Coordination project will be active through FY25.
The final breakout session is an opportunity for workshop attendees to inform the direction
of future efforts around software quality including within the scope of the
Portfolio Coordination project.

Topic suggestions:
- Establish a software quality czar to consult with particular groups or models
- Focus on interoperability / model alignment
- Establish common inputs (i.e. windIO)

## Rules of Engagement

````{card}
Respect the group's time and attention
^^^
Many people are traveling to attend this workshop, and everyone is setting aside a full day.
Please keep all attention within the workshop.
- Laptops should remain closed. Note taking on paper is preferred.
- Step out of the room to use a phone including sending emails or text messages that require
  more than a few seconds to write.
````

````{card} 
Discuss rather than debate
^^^
Each breakout session is meant to create discussion and conversation.
Arriving at one answer is not required and, in most cases, not desired.
The objective is mutual understanding of perspectives.

**Lunch and refreshments**

We will have a group lunch at the RSF Cafe, and it will not be covered by the workshop.
Coffee and refreshments will be provided within the workshop room.

<!-- TODO Find the right elevator to get the 4th floor A wing -->

**Breakout sessions**

Each breakout session will have its own room.
One person should be designated as the reporter to report back overarching themes in the
conversation.
Additional note takers would be helpful to capture more information.
The results of these breakout sessions will be included in a report summarizing the workshop,
and they will inform future portfolio coordination efforts.

**Parking**

NREL staff should park in the parking garage and visitors should park in the visitor lot
near the East Gate entrance.
See the map below for guidance.
