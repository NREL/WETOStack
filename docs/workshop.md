# Model Owners Workshop

This project will support an annual workshop to build the community of WETO software
owners. The first workshop will be held on September 7, 2023, at NREL's Golden Campus.
The objective of the workshop is to initiate the conversations around two primary topics:
1. Holistically evaluating the WETO software portfolio
2. Establishing a community-wide consensus on software quality expectations

Being a community-focused workshop, there will be four breakout sessions where attendees will
discuss topics as a group. The results of these discussions will be reported back to the full
workshop, and they will also be incorporated into their associated aspects of the
Portfolio Coordination project.

(breakout1)=
## Breakout 1: What is the purpose of WETO Software?

This breakout session follows an update from WETO on their perspective and focus on the software
we produce.
The discussions should be informed by low-level experience but maintain a high-level perspective.
The objective of this breakout session is to establish a mutual understanding of the group's
perspective on the role and impact of WETO software.

Topic suggestions:
- To create the tools to support our own research
- To establish a mechanism to disseminate our research
- To provide the industry with tools to design wind energy systems
- To full industry adoption


Third option:
- how might we engage with independent organizations to deal with these long term maintenance burdens
  - inter (?) foundation
  - Apache foundation
  - Linux foundation



## Breakout 2: In what direction should WETO software go?

This breakout session follows an overview of the current WETO software portfolio including
descriptions of the domain areas covered and state of maturity.
Building on the discussions in [Breakout 1](breakout1) and the portfolio overview, this session
focuses on defining the forward-looking technical and domain-specific topics that WETO software
should pursue.
The objective is to align the community's expectations around critical future considerations.

Topic suggestions:
- Integration to other ecosystems (AI/ML, optimizations)
- WETO software interoperability

## Breakout 3: What are the major bottlenecks in our development processes?

This breakout session follows an overview of [Best Practices](bestpractices) described
within the Portfolio Coordination project.
The objective is to identify the key bottlenecks in our current workflows with particular
attention to things that prevent WETO software from achieving the impacts identified
in [Breakout 1](breakout1).
The discussions here will be incorporated into the best practices technical report.

Topic suggestions:
- Staff and programmatic incentives
- Technical barriers - do we have access to the tools we need?
- Personnel barriers - do we have staff with the relevant experience?
- What's missing in the proposed best practices?

## Breakout 4: Where to invest time and efforts in the upcoming FY's

The Portfolio Coordination project will be active through FY25.
The final breakout session is an opportunity for workshop attendees to inform the direction
of future efforts around software quality including within the scope of the
Portfolio Coordination project.

Topic suggestions:
- Establish a software quality czar to consult with particular groups or models
- Focus on interoperability / model alignment
- Establish common inputs (i.e. windIO)
