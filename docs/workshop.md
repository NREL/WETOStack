# Model Owners Workshop

A component of the Holistic Modeling Portfolio Coordination Project is to coordinate and host
an annual workshop with the purpose of strengthening the community of WETO software owners.
**The first workshop will be help on September 7, 2023, at NREL's Golden Campus.**

The objective of the first workshop is to *initialize* the community.
To that end, two primary topics will be threaded throughout the conversations:
1. Opportunities and strategies to elevate the quality of WETO software
2. Holistic evaluation of the existing portfolio

There will be four breakout sessions where attendees will discuss topics as a group.
Prior to the breakouts, preplanned talks from WETO and members of the Holistic Modeling project
will seed the conversations in the following breakouts. Please see the [](workshop_agenda)
for details.

(breakout1)=
## Breakout 1: What is the purpose of WETO Software?

This breakout session follows an update from WETO on their perspective and focus on the software
we produce.
The discussions should be informed by low-level experience but maintain a high-level perspective.
The objective of this breakout session is to establish a mutual understanding of the group's
perspective on the role and impact of WETO software within the broad context of wind energy.

Topic suggestions:
- To create the tools to support our own research
- To establish a mechanism to disseminate our research
- To provide the industry with tools to design wind energy systems
- To full industry adoption

## Breakout 2: In what direction should WETO software go?

This breakout session follows an overview of the current WETO software portfolio including
descriptions of the domain areas covered and state of maturity.
Building on the discussions in [Breakout 1](breakout1) and the portfolio overview, this session
focuses on defining the forward-looking technical and domain-specific topics that WETO software
should pursue.
The objective is to align the community's expectations around critical future considerations.

Topic suggestions:
- Integration to other ecosystems (AI/ML, optimizations)
- WETO software interoperability

## Breakout 3: What are the major bottlenecks in our development processes?

This breakout session follows an overview of [Best Practices](bestpractices) described
within the Portfolio Coordination project.
The objective is to identify the key bottlenecks in our current workflows with particular
attention to things that prevent WETO software from achieving the impacts identified
in [Breakout 1](breakout1).
The discussions here will be incorporated into the best practices technical report.

Topic suggestions:
- Staff and programmatic incentives
- Technical barriers - do we have access to the tools we need?
- Personnel barriers - do we have staff with the relevant experience?
- What's missing in the proposed best practices?

## Breakout 4: Where to invest time and efforts in the upcoming FY's

The Portfolio Coordination project will be active through FY25.
The final breakout session is an opportunity for workshop attendees to inform the direction
of future efforts around software quality including within the scope of the
Portfolio Coordination project.

Topic suggestions:
- Establish a software quality czar to consult with particular groups or models
- Focus on interoperability / model alignment
- Establish common inputs (i.e. windIO)


## Rules of Engagement

Given the nature of a day-long meeting with lots of group discussion, it is important to
establish rules for engagement.

1. Many people are traveling to attend this workshop, and everyone is setting aside a full day.
    To respect each other's time and effort, please keep all attention within the workshop.
    - Laptops should remain closed. Note taking on paper is preferred.
    - Step out of the room to use a phone including sending emails or text messages that require
      more than a few seconds to write.

2. Offer mutual respect. Each of the breakout sessions is meant to create discussion and
    conversation. Arriving at one answer is required and in most cases not desired. The
    objective is mutual understanding of perspectives.
