# Rubric

## Background

This rubric has been developed to provide a common mechanism and process for evaluating the
following aspects of software development efforts funded by WETO.  The goals of the rubric are to:

- Establish the current state of each software project
- Give WETO and Lab leaders a sense for the portfolio strengths and weaknesses
- Provide model owners an ability to identify their software needs
- Empower projects to set software improvement milestones as part of their annual operating plans
- Establish data for the trajectory of a software project over time

## Rubric benefits

A common software rubric for the WETO Stack provides:

- A common method to evaluate project maturity and quality
- For a given line item, or even a rubric report for an individual model is most directly meaningful to model owners
- Across all models, the rubric captures the maturity and quality of the WETO Software Stack
- A common language to talk about the state and needs of software projects between model owners and WETO managers
- A development roadmap for planning
- An understanding of software maturity and management of expectations for model users

## Rubric structure

The software grading rubric is structured as a set of criteria categorized into software quality topics.
Each specific criteria is assigned a rating or "not applicable."
The dark to light color gradient rating system corresponds to Low, Medium, and High levels of
satisfaction for that particular criteria. Since the needs of a particular software change as
a function of the maturity level, current funding, target audience, size of the user base,
and level of impact, a "priority level" is associated to each criteria to function as a
subjective weighting of importance.
In this system, most software projects will have a range of scores, and low or high are not
necessarily good or bad.
Instead, they are a holistic measure of software maturity and quality across the portfolio.

The topic areas currently included are:

- **Accessibility**: How easy is it to obtain and install?
- **Usability**: How easy is it to use?
- **Documentation**: Is it well described?
- **Extendability**: How easy is it for new developers to contribute?
- **Verification**: How accurate are the results?
- **Community Health**: How engaged are users?

The criteria for each topic area and the characteristics that warrant a Low, Medium, of High
rating are described below.
Software rubric scores for specific models within the WETO Stack are not provided here, as they
are in flux for actively developed projects.
However, the individual model owners may choose to share their scoring within their
respective documentation sites if desired.
