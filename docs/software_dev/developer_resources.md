# Developer Training

The page contains a collection of training material for research software developers.
Consider this list a loose collection of resources rather than a comprehensive series.
This page was written by Rafael Mudafort, and I give my own recommendations and opinions
included in the descriptions below. Feel free to reach out to me with questions or comments.

## Internal to NREL

This section section contains training material that was developed at NREL and requires
access to the NREL VPN to view.

- **Lunch and learn style talks** by Rafael Mudafort given at NWTC between 2019 and 2020
    - Some are better than others but all are aimed at new hires, especially interns and post docs.
      The objective was to elevate the skill set for those at NWTC who had the least confidence
      in software development and generally using a computer in this way
      (command line, ssh, IDE’s, etc).
    - [OOP with Python](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/7ef3ea9c-dad9-496d-b9df-927f87b00ca4)
    - [conda as a development tool](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/059eaab4-8c1b-4cdb-aa16-c1ed1c081756?list=studio)
    - [VS Code as a development tool with NREL-specific tips](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/202a8a28-80c5-4142-a283-e603134a313f?list=studio)
    - [Basic git usage](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/6646b872-9e26-44a5-bda9-078d5b3fc65e?list=studio)
    - Advanced git usage: getting out of a problem (Not recorded but this one should be given again and recorded)

- MBAP **Software Engineering for Engineering Software** (SEES) Seminar Series
    - [Full list of seminars](https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/SEES/wiki/Past-Seminars)
    - [Git good: Advanced Git and GitHub features](https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/SEES/wiki/Past-Seminars#git-good-advanced-git-and-github-features)
    - [Mutable vs immutable objects and how they impact design and performance in Python](https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/SEES/wiki/Past-Seminars#mutable-vs-immutable-objects-and-how-they-impact-design-and-performance-in-python)
    - [Python Command Line Applications](https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/SEES/wiki/Past-Seminars#python-command-line-applications)
    - [Debugging](https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/SEES/wiki/Past-Seminars#debugging)

- Computational Sciences Tutorials
    - [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a6nLmPDt9QHQMEuLHVBaxfsitEZSGH6oXT6lyVauMvXY1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=22ad3c7b-a45a-4880-b8b4-b70b989f1344&tenantId=a0f29d7e-28cd-4f54-8442-7885aee7c080)
    - [Streams channel](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/40dc1af3-7160-423a-881f-6d5e5576350b)
    - This is from the DAV group and there is a lot of content. I have not watched all of these
      because there are so many, but the ones I have watched are pretty good. Some tend to be
      focused on database management and web development – things that are less applicable to
      NWTC. However, there’s some really good stuff here especially the ones focused on HPC
      usage. I would suggest this to new hires as “extracurricular”. After they have a good
      foundation on the topics they’ll be using in their day to day, these tutorials would
      broaden their knowledge a bit and hopefully spark curiosity.

## External

While there are infinite resources for software development training on the internet,
I've found these to be particular relevant to work at NWTC.

- Missing Semester of CS Education from MIT
    - This is a really excellent resource for practical topics on using a computer in the
      way we do in scientific research. It should be the first stop for new hires.
      It’s very approachable and you can skip around sections.
    - [Full list of topics](https://missing.csail.mit.edu)
    - [1/13/20: Course overview + the shell](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/)
    - [1/21/20: Command-line Environment](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/command-line/)
    - [1/22/20: Version Control (Git)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)
    - [1/23/20: Debugging and Profiling](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/debugging-profiling/)
    - [1/27/20: Metaprogramming](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/metaprogramming/)

- [IDEAS HPC Best Practices](https://ideas-productivity.org/resources/series/hpc-best-practices-webinars/)
    - These tutorials are aimed at national labs and scientific researchers.
      They can be quite broad, but generally are well thought out.
      While I find many of them only tangentially relevant, a few have really
      shaped the way I think about software at the lab over the past few years, and
      I've listed some of those below.
    - Software Design Patterns in Research Software with Examples from OpenFOAM
    - What I Learned from 20 Years of Leading Open Source Projects
    - Software Engineering Challenges and Best Practices for Multi-Institutional Scientific Software Development 
    - A Workflow for Increasing the Quality of Scientific Software (in Computational Science and Engineering)
    - Modern C++ for High Performance Computing
    - Modern CMake

- US RSE Education and Training seminar series
    - I highly recommend engaging with [US RSE](https://us-rse.org/), in general, since there
      are many other resources supporting both the practice of research software engineering
      and the people themselves
