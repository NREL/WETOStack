- PROPID: PROP Inverse Design (PROPID) is aerodynamic design software developed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. You can use it to design rotors.
- DrivePy: DrivePy is physics-based drivetrain model that sizes drivetrain components based on aerodynamic and operational loads for use in a systems engineering model. It also calculates costs based on empirical data collected by NREL's National Wind Technology Center.
- JacketSE: This is a module for static hydrodynamic, aerodynamic, and structural design and analysis of wind turbine jacket and towers within the Systems Engineering toolbox.
- Nacelle Systems Engineering Model and Hub Systems Engineering Model: nacelleSE and hubSE are models that size wind turbine hub system and drivetrain components based on key turbine design parameters and load inputs from a rotor model.
- LandOpExSE: This is a cost model for operational expenditures for land-based wind plants.
- INN Airfoil Tools: This software package contains code to perform airfoil inverse shape design using a sparsified invertible neural network model. This is a specialized deep learning architecture that enables both network weights to be shared to evaluate forward or inverse passes through the network. As a design tool, this network allows practitioners to specify aerodynamic and structural properties and generate shapes that satisfy those properties.
