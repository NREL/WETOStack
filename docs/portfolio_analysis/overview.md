# Portfolio Overview

The set of software under the WETO umbrella is detailed and categorized in the nested pages below.  There are many ways to subdivide the WETO Stack.  Some models are focused on a single turbine component, others on the whole turbine, others on the farm, and others on an even larger spatial scale.  Some models deal with the engineering, others on the cost.  For the engineering models, there is a range of fidelities from low-fidelity models intended for conceptual design, to the highest fidelity models that take hours or days to complete, and many mid-fidelity models that are common tools for industry.  Additionally, many larger models are comprised on individual modules that could be used as standalones.

An overview of the WETO Stack is provided in the image and table below, with more comprehensive listing and categorization in the nested pages.
