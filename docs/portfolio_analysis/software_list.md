# Portfolio Listing

The set of software under the WETO umbrella is listed here.
This is intended to eventually be a complete list, but it is likely missing some projects yet.
Please [suggest an edit](https://github.com/rafmudaf/wetostack/edit/main/docs/portfolio_analysis/software_list.md)
if nay information here is incorrect.

This listing contains two groups of software projects:

1. WETO-funded software
2. Other projects funded by various agencies and mechanisms

All of these tools relate to some aspect of wind energy development from component design
and analysis to cost modeling and supply chain analysis.
