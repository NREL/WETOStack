# WETO Software Stack

The WETO Software Stack is the software portfolio wholly or partially supported by the Department of Energy's [Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO)](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/wind-energy-technologies-office).  Through the national laboratories and their univeristy collaborators, this portfolio includes engineering and techno-economic models focused on wind energy across a spectrum of model fidelities and use cases.  While a "software stack" usually refers to a set of integrated software codes, the portfolio of codes in the WETO Stack is diverse and can be used individually or integrated, depending on the use case.
