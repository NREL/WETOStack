# WETO Software Stack

NREL's National Wind Technology Center has been engaged in a multiyear effort to elevate the
quality and robustness of the software portfolio supported by Department of Energy's Wind Energy
Technologies Office (WETO). To achieve this goal, a dedicated "Portfolio Coordination" project
was established with the following focus areas:

- Characterize the existing software portfolio to identify quality levels, capabilities, and gaps
- Identify challenges and opportunities in the current software development processes
- Build a community of model owners who participate in annual workshops to discuss the state of
  the WETO software portfolio and identify future road maps

This dashboard contains the results and information related to each focus area.
