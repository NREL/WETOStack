# WETO Software Stack

NREL's National Wind Technology Center is engaged in a multiyear effort to elevate the
quality and robustness of the WETO Software Stack, the software portfolio supported by
Department of Energy's [Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO)](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/wind-energy-technologies-office).
To achieve this goal, a dedicated *Portfolio Coordination* project is under way with the
following focus areas:

- Characterize the existing software portfolio to identify quality levels, capabilities, and gaps
- Identify challenges and opportunities in the current software development processes
- Build a community of model owners and practitioners who participate in annual workshops to
  discuss the state of the WETO software portfolio and develop future road maps

This dashboard contains the results and information related to each focus area.
