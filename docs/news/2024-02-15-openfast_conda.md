# OpenFAST on conda-forge

Historically, using OpenFAST has meant obtaining (downloading or getting access to) the Fortran
source code, installing compilers and math libraries, and figuring out how to compile the
project for your specific system.
This can be a major barrier to entry for many users who just want to start modeling
wind turbines.
Since 2020, OpenFAST has been available on conda-forge for Linux and macOS systems.
However, distributing the software for Windows has been a challenge due to the
complexity of the build process and the lack of a standard Fortran compiler on Windows.
We are happy to announce that OpenFAST is now available on conda-forge for all three major
operating systems!

## Add details on the challenges in building OpenFAST for Windows
What were the specifics?
How were they solved?
Any interesting journeys getting to the end?
Maybe link to the pull requests that completed this work
